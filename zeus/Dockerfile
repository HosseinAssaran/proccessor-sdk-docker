# In any directory on the docker host, perform the following actions:
#   * Copy this Dockerfile in the directory.
#   * Create input and output directories: mkdir -p yocto/output yocto/input
#   * Build the Docker image with the following command:
#     docker build --no-cache --build-arg "host_uid=$(id -u)" --build-arg "host_gid=$(id -g)" --tag "cuteradio-zeus" .
#   * Run the Docker image, which in turn runs the Yocto and which produces the Linux rootfs,
#     with the following command:
#     docker run -it --rm -v $PWD:/public/Work cuteradio-zeus

# Use Ubuntu 18.04 LTS (Bionic Beaver) as the basis for the Docker image.
